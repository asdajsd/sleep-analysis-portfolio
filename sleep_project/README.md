# 💤 What Drives Sleep? A Data-Driven Exploration of Animal Sleep Patterns

## 📌 Objective
Explore biological and ecological factors that influence daily sleep duration across animal species.

## 📊 Dataset
- 62 species
- Features: body weight, brain weight, lifespan, gestation, risk indices, total sleep hours

## ✅ Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and transformation
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Regression modeling
4. Insights and visualization

## 🔍 Highlights
- Strong negative correlation between body size and sleep duration
- Danger and predation indexes show positive influence on sleep
- Random Forest outperforms linear regression in prediction
