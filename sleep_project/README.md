The **Sleep Analysis Portfolio** project explores the relationship between sleep patterns and various lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, caffeine consumption, and stress levels. The goal is to uncover valuable insights that can inform healthier sleep habits and improve overall well-being. The primary dataset, **sleep_cleaned.csv**, includes columns such as sleep duration, quality, and onset latency, alongside lifestyle factors like physical activity and caffeine intake.

The analysis employs various techniques, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, time series analysis, and data visualization, to identify relationships between sleep and lifestyle factors. Key findings highlight that increased physical activity is associated with better sleep quality, higher caffeine intake shortens sleep duration, and elevated stress levels reduce sleep efficiency. Visualizations further illustrate these relationships, making the findings clear and actionable. Technologies used include Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook. The project is open for contributions, and is licensed under the MIT License.
