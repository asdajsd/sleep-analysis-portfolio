# Sleep Analysis Portfolio

The **Sleep Analysis Portfolio** is a complete data science workflow designed to explore and model patterns in human sleep behavior using structured physiological data. This project emphasizes reproducibility, modularity, and professional best practices in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and optional predictive modeling.

## Overview

The repository demonstrates a practical application of data science principles, including:

- Cleaning and standardizing raw data
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing key patterns and relationships
- Optionally training machine learning models
- Maintaining a modular and reusable project structure

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asdajsd/sleep-analysis-portfolio.git
   cd sleep-analysis-portfolio
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Reproduce Cleaned Data

Generate the cleaned dataset by running:

```bash
python scripts/data_cleaning.py
```

This will recreate `data/sleep_cleaned.csv` with consistent formatting, rounded numeric values, and removal of anomalies.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

Open the Jupyter notebook for EDA:

```bash
open notebooks/eda_sleep.ipynb
```

Execute all cells to generate visual insights, which will be saved to the `eda_visuals/` directory. Visualizations include:

- Distribution of total sleep
- Correlation heatmaps
- Scatter plots with log scaling

### Step 3: Modeling (Optional)

To train and evaluate a predictive model:

```bash
python scripts/train_sleep_model.py
```

Model artifacts and evaluation metrics will be saved to the `models/` directory.

## Data Description

| Column              | Type    | Description                                  |
|---------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| `total_sleep`       | Float   | Total sleep per day (hours)                  |
| `max_life_span`     | Float   | Maximum observed lifespan (days)             |
| `gestation_time`    | Float   | Gestation period (days)                      |
| `predation_index`   | Integer | Risk of being preyed upon (scaled)           |
| `sleep_exposure_index` | Float | Relative exposure to environmental threats   |

All columns are cleaned and normalized for analysis.
