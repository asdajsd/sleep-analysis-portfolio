Usage
Reproduce cleaned data

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/data_cleaning.py
This regenerates data/sleep_cleaned.csv.

Run exploratory analysis

Open notebooks/eda_sleep.ipynb.

Execute all cells to produce visual outputs saved under eda_visuals/.

Train or load models (if implemented)

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/train_sleep_model.py
Model artifacts and evaluation metrics will be stored in models/.

Data Description

Column	Type	Description
total_sleep	Float	Hours of sleep per day
max_life_span	Float	Maximum lifespan (days)
gestation_time	Float	Gestation period (days)
predation_index	Integer	Predation risk index (1–5)
sleep_exposure_index	Integer	Sleep exposure index (1–5)
…	…	Additional features
Source: [Link or citation to original dataset]

Cleaning steps:

Remove null values and extreme outliers

Round numeric fields to two decimal places

Exploratory Data Analysis
Key visual insights include:

Distribution of Total Sleep

Correlation Heatmap of physiological metrics

Scatter Plot of Brain vs. Body Weight (log‑scaled)

All figures are stored in eda_visuals/.

Modeling (Optional)
Only relevant if predictive or clustering models have been implemented.

Train a model

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/train_sleep_model.py
Evaluate and save artifacts

Metrics and confusion matrices saved to models/

Example usage in notebooks/modeling_sleep.ipynb

Dependencies
