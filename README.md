# Sleep Analysis Portfolio

The Sleep Analysis Portfolio presents a comprehensive data science workflow that investigates human sleep patterns. Using a raw dataset of physiological metrics, this project demonstrates rigorous data cleaning, insightful visualizations, and optional predictive modeling. To get started, users must have Python 3.8 or newer and the pip package manager installed. Installation involves cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, and installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

Once set up, the `scripts/data_cleaning.py` script can reproduce the cleaned dataset, rounding numeric values to two decimal places and removing anomalies. Exploratory analysis is performed in the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/eda_sleep.ipynb`, where executing all cells generates charts saved under `eda_visuals/`. These visualizations include the distribution of total sleep hours, correlation heatmaps of physiological features, and log‑scaled scatter plots of brain versus body weight.

For projects that implement modeling, running `scripts/train_sleep_model.py` trains, evaluates, and saves model artifacts and performance metrics to the `models/` directory. The core dataset features columns such as `total_sleep`, `max_life_span`, `gestation_time`, `predation_index`, and `sleep_exposure_index`, each documented and cleaned for consistency. The original dataset source and citation are provided within the repository to acknowledge data provenance and enable reproducibility.

Contributors can fork the repository, create feature branches, and submit pull requests, ensuring adherence to PEP 8 standards and cleared notebook outputs. All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with a single pip command.
